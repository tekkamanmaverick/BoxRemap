This program demonstrates visually how the unit cube may be remapped into a
cuboid.  It requires a relatively recent version of Python (>= 2.5 should
suffice), as well the Pyglet multimedia library (available for all platforms
from www.pyglet.org).

To run:
    python demo.py

Mouse control:
    Left-click drag: rotate
    Right-click drag: pan
    Mouse wheel: zoom

Key bindings:
    R: reset view
    J: snap to unit cube configuration
    K: snap to remapped cuboid configuration
    Space: oscillate smoothly between configurations
    1-9: change cuboid remapping
    S: save screenshot to file "figure.png"
