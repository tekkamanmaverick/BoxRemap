Quick start:
    make genremap
    ./genremap 7 > list7.txt


The genremap program generates a list of possible cuboid remappings.  It uses a
brute force search to find invertible 3x3 integer matrices with coefficients in
the range
    -Nmax <= u_ij <= Nmax,
where Nmax may be passed on the command line (default is 5).  Each invertible
matrix U = (u1,u2,u3) leads to a cuboid with edge vectors e1, e2, e3 given by
    e1 = u1
    e2 = u2 + a*u1              (*)
    e3 = u3 + b*u1 + c*u2
where a,b,c are chosen to make e1, e2, e3 mutually orthogonal.  Explicitly
    a = -(u1 . u2)/|u1|^2
    c = -(a * (u1 . u3) + (u2 . u3)) / (a * (u1 . u2) + |u2|^2)
    b = -((u1 . u3) + c * (u1 . u2)) / |u1|^2
where "." denotes a dot product.

The results of this brute force search are printed to stdout (which can be
easily redirected to file).  The format of the output is as follows:
- First come two lines commented by a '#' character: line one tells what Nmax
  was used, line two provides column headers for the remappings to follow.
- The remappings are then listed, one per line.  The first three columns show
  the dimensions of the cuboid,
    L1 = |e1|,  L2 = |e2|,  L3 = |e3|,
  to four decimal places.  These are the columns that should be investigated
  when searching for a particular remapping to suit your particular needs.
  The next nine columns give the coefficients of the integer matrix U that led
  to this remapping, according to the Equations (*) above.  The last column
  indicates which of the edge vectors e1, e2, e3 are lattice vectors: the
  remapped cuboid will be periodic along these directions.
- The cuboid remappings are sorted by the length of their longest edge.
  Because of the way the edge vectors e1, e2, e3 are calculated, Equations (*),
  the longest edge will not necessarily be e1.
- Note that the edge vectors themselves are not printed.  For numerical
  reasons, it is best to recalculate these from the integer matrix coefficients
  in the piece of code that actually performs the remapping.

To compile, try the command:
    make genremap
This requires the 'make' program and a C++ compiler.  You can edit the Makefile
if you want to change the compile flags or force 'make' to use a particular
compiler.  Once compiled, you would typically run the program with the command:
    ./genremap 7 > list7.txt
Note that the run time and output size grow very rapidly with Nmax (the scaling
is ~ Nmax^7 over the range 2 <= Nmax < 10), so beware.  On an average 2008-era
laptop, the above command will take a few minutes.
